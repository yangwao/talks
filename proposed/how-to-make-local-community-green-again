# How to make local communities green again

In past, I helped found local hackerspace in Bratislava called Progressbar, in 2010. 
Then it all started happening for me.
I've started orging some easy events like who is spying on you, where I've become member of TelecomixBSRE. 
Also helped throw Cryptoparties that times. Then it comes up with visit of CCCamp2011. Then Bitcoin enters in.
I had some ideas, helped orging some Bitcoin Meetups as well, also some little Bitcoin unconference (Bitcoin market), 
before I lead Slovakia Bitcoin magazine, Bitcoiner.sk and found forum around bitcoin coinunity.sk.
Helped bootstrap first Fablab in Bratislava, it felt great! During that I found some digital manufacturing group Fablava.sk
Next I continued to start with coding, went great with Girl's day, to atract more girls into ICT. Done it two times.
Now doing finally Nodeschool Bratislava, first event went pretty great, over 60 folks came in. 
Now we are doing #4 Nodeschool in Bratislava. Now I'm planning to spark more IPFS community around.
On behind all of this scene, I'm keeping up local hackerspace Progressbar sustainable and doing some living on my own.
Here comes plot, I plan setup small hacker residency // hackbase in Central Europe, hackerdome.xyz.
Hackerdome.xyz already had visit from Calafou, now need to polish things and start happening.
But it's just small step. I plan to make it little much bigger. There is abaddoned waterworks near. 
That's why I will need you :)
